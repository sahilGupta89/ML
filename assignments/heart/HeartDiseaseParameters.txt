Problem
This problem is centered around predicting the presence of hearth disease based on 14 attributes. To solve this problem, we will build an ML model that takes as inputs 4 parameters: Attribute Information:
(age) - Age
(sex) - (1 = male; 0 = female)
(cp) chest pain type -- Value 1: typical angina -- Value 2: atypical angina -- Value 3: non-anginal pain -- Value 4: asymptomatic
(trestbps) - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
(chol) - serum cholestoral in mg/dl
(fbs) - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
(restecg) - esting electrocardiographic results -- Value 0: normal -- Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV) -- Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
(thalach) - maximum heart rate achieved
(exang) - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
(oldpeak) - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
(slope) - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment -- Value 1: upsloping -- Value 2: flat -- Value 3: downsloping
(ca) - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
(thal) - 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
(num) (the predicted attribute) diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status) -- Value 0: < 50% diameter narrowing -- Value 1: > 50% diameter narrowing (in any major vessel: attributes 59 through 68 are vessels)
and predicts the presence of heart disease in the patient with integer values from 0 to 4: Experiments with the Cleveland database (dataset used for this example) have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0).
